# Portfolio
Here's my current portfolio of some interesting project's I've conducted. These projects were accomplished using Python (feel free to ask for my JUPYTR Notebooks), R, and SQL. 

## Economic Outlook Report, Housing Prices Silicon Valley 
* This analysis forecasts the Silicon Valley, Bay Area's housing price index (HPI), inventory, and market hotness. In this research, I leveraged the St. Louis Fred's API to pull data regarding the Housing Price Index (HPI), Inventory, and Market Hotness. 

## The Analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Price 
* The goal of this project is to understand how charging is priced on the basis of location and firm. Feel free to message me with questions pertaining to the analysis and data leveraged in this project on linkedIn.
